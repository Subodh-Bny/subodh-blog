# Introduction

[React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react) are a fundamental feature for React development that allows us to add state and other React features to functional components. While basic hooks are relatively straightforward, mastering advanced techniques can dramatically improve your development workflow.

## Modern React Hooks

### [useState Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)

useState provides state management capabilities:

- Managing local component state
- State updates with functional updates
- Lazy initial state
- Multiple state variables

### [useEffect Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)

Modern side effects management offers:

- Handling component lifecycle
- Data fetching
- Subscriptions
- Cleanup functions

### [useContext Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)

Context hook provides:

- Global state management
- Theme management
- Prop drilling prevention
- Dynamic updates

## Advanced Hooks

### [Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)

- useLocalStorage()
- useDebounce()
- usePrevious()
- useWindowSize()
- useOnClickOutside()

### [Performance Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)

- useMemo()
- useCallback()
- useRef()

## Additional Hooks

### [Other Built-in Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)

```jsx
// useReducer example
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

// useLayoutEffect example
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // DOM mutation operations
  return () => {
    // cleanup
  };
}, [dependency]);

// useImperativeHandle example
useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
  focus: () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  },
}));
```
